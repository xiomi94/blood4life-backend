# Blood4Life

## About this project

This repository constitutes a project that mix all our subjects of the Higher-Level Training Cycle in Web Application Development
that we are currently completing. The project consists of a full-stack application, meaning it encompasses an entire
server infrastructure that defines its existence, logic, and storage, ensuring complete, robust, and proper
functionality based on configurations we decided upon collectively.

The guiding theme for developing this project is that it must be social. We thought of an implementation purpose that
would improve and aid the management of blood donations for the hospitals.

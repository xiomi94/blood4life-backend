# Blood4Life

## Introduction

This repository constitutes an inter-modular project for the Higher-Level Training Cycle in Web Application Development that we are currently completing. The project consists of a full-stack application, meaning it encompasses an entire server infrastructure that defines its existence, logic, and storage, ensuring complete, robust, and proper functionality based on configurations we decided upon collectively.

The guiding theme for developing this project is that it must be social. We thought of an implementation purpose that would improve and aid the management of blood donations for island hospitals (in this case, Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain).

It is broken down as follows:
